### please support pyro
here is a simple introduction about this plugin, first note is **please support and purchase** [PyroFishing by PyroTempus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/pyrofishingpro-1-14-x-1-21-x-1-fishing-plugin-new-tournament-rework.60729/), He deserves credit and praise for the initial project concept and many of the initial ideas presented. 

It would be unethical and wrong for this project to receieve any type of funding or outspoken support due to its "copycat" nature, if this project receieves funding of any kind, it will be donated directly to pyro. okay now onto an explanation of why it exists.

### why does it exist
i have created this plugin as a challenge to create a more extensive version of pyrofishing, open sourced, developer friendly plugin instead of a closed source project where you're at the will of what pyro wants to add (like a lack of support for datapack biomes). 
this is supposed to place the power in the user to add whatever augment, skill, totem upgrade or anything they desire for their project and to make it as complex as they desire.

### plugin requirements
This plugin will always be compiled against the latest Paper API Versions (as of writing, its 1.21.3) with no goal in supporting anything lower than latest. this is because i want to be stubborn and defiant, and because their api changes go hard.
